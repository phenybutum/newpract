During this task i've learned how to create an issue and how to work with this. 
In this part of work i used labels, milestones, assignees and comments to do it well.
Also i've trained my skills in work with projects on GitHub, including using automated kanban and no-automated template.
Also in commits and pull requests i used 'magic' words to close issues.
To sum up, i must say it was really interesting and useful task.
Thanks to Kate for colaboration :)

Doing this task, i've learned something new about issues: creating it and solving.
In our project we createdn new lables, milestones and successfully implemented it. 
We tried to work with templates. Got the knowledge how to make own template according to project needs.
And learned useful stuff about pull requests and "magic" words, as my colleague has mentioned.
It was nice and useful to train skills with this task. 
Thanks to Volodymyr for it.
